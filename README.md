# AntsVsBees
A Game similar to plants vs zombies

# The Game
A game of Ants Vs. SomeBees consists of a series of turns. In each turn, new bees may enter the ant colony. 
Then, new ants are placed to defend their colony. Finally, all insects (ants, then bees) take individual actions. 
Bees either try to move toward the end of the tunnel or sting ants in their way. Ants perform a different action depending on their type, such as collecting more food or throwing leaves at the bees. 
The game ends either when a bee reaches the end of the tunnel (you lose), the bees destroy the QueenAnt if it exists (you lose), or the entire bee fleet has been vanquished (you win).

# Important Note
I'm responsible only of implementing the ants.py file thats where the whole game logic lies in.
